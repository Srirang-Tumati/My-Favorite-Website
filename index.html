                <p>My favorite hobby is to play my favorite video game, Fortnite in my free time. This is my favorite hobby because it is fun and engaging to play for me and I can also play with my friends online, isn't that very cool. Now here is few sentences that will tell you about this awsome game:Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite.
